🚀 Day 2 Goal Accomplished! 🎯

Today marked another significant milestone in our hackathon journey! 🛠️
We worked on converting our business planning into a technical plan to bring our marketplace idea to life. Here's what we achieved:

What We Did:

1️⃣ Defined Technical Requirements

Designed an interactive Frontend (Next.js) with pages for:

Homepage
Product Listing
Cart
Checkout
Set up Sanity CMS to manage products and orders efficiently.
Planned the integration of Third-Party APIs for payments and shipment tracking.

2️⃣ Created System Architecture

Designed a simple architecture diagram illustrating component interactions:

🖥️ Frontend ↔️ Sanity CMS ↔️ APIs (Payments & Shipment).

3️⃣ Defined APIs

Planned essential endpoints like:

/products (GET): Fetch all products.
/cart (POST): Add items to the cart.
/order (POST): Place orders.

4️⃣ Drafted Sanity CMS Schema

Created a schema for products with fields like:
Name
Price
Description
Image

5️⃣ Prepared Documentation

Documented all aspects, including:
System architecture
API requirements
Workflow diagrams

6️⃣ Group Discussions & Feedback

Collaborated with peers and mentors to refine our technical plan.
Incorporated valuable suggestions for a more robust and effective system.
Key Outcome:

🔑 By the end of the day, we achieved:
✅ A well-defined technical plan.
✅ A system diagram for better visualization.
✅ Comprehensive API documentation.
✅ A draft schema for managing data.

🌟 The journey continues! Tomorrow, we gear up for the next step: implementation and coding. Let’s create something extraordinary together. 💻💡
